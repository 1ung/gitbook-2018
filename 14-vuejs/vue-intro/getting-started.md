# Getting Started

All contents on this page can be found on the official Vue.js guide [here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html)!  

The easiest way to set up a VueJS application is to use a direct `<script>` include in the `<head>` of your html file. By including this script, all Vue.js features can be accessed in your html page.  
```
<head>
  ...
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"></script>
  ...
</head>
```
