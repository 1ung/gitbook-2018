1. conditionals:
  - create a variable `monkey` that creates a random number from 1 to 10 (just copy and paste this code): `var monkey = Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(10));`
  - for each conditional you write, also console.log the word `chocolate` after the conditional statement (closing curly brace).
Example:
```
if( 3 == 4 ){

}
console.log("chocolate");
```
  - write a conditional that will `console.log` `hello` if `monkey` is less than 6
  - write a conditional that will `console.log` `goodbye` if `monkey` is 6 or is more than six.
  - write a conditional with an else statement- `console.log` `cats` if `monkey` is less than 3, otherwise `console.log` `goats`
  - write a conditional with an else statement- `console.log` `almonds` if `monkey` is less than 9, otherwise `console.log` `jelly`

  - create another variable `johnathan` that creates a random number from 1 to 10 (just copy and paste this code): `var johnathan = Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(10));`

  - write a conditional that will `console.log` `dollars` if `monkey` is 6 or less than 6 and `johnathan` is less than 5
  - write a conditional with an else statement- `console.log` `dogs` if `monkey` is 3 and `johnathan` is less than 5, otherwise `console.log` `submarine`
  - write a conditional with an else statement- `console.log` `puppies` if `monkey` is more than 7 or `johnathan` is less than 3, otherwise `console.log` `godzilla`
  - write a conditional that will `console.log` `halifax` if `monkey` is 6 or less than 6 and `johnathan` is less than 5 and `johnathan` is not 3
  - write a conditional that will `console.log` `halifax` if `monkey` is 6 or less than 6 and `johnathan` is less than 5 and `johnathan` is not 3

  - write a conditional with an if else statement- `console.log` `electric` if `monkey` is less than 3, but, if `monkey` is equal to 5, `console.log` `camper van`
  - write a conditional with an if else statement- `console.log` `toes` if `monkey` is more than 3, but, if `monkey` is equal to 1, `console.log` `shoelace`
  - write a conditional with an if else statement- `console.log` `curry` if `monkey` is more than 9, but, if `monkey` is equal to 4, `console.log` `future`. Otherwise `console.log` `orchid`.

  - write a conditional that will `console.log` `danube` if `monkey` is less than 6 or `johnathan` is less than 3, but, if `monkey` is more than 7 and `johnathan` is equal to 9, `console.log` `trumpet`. Otherwise `console.log` `brains`
