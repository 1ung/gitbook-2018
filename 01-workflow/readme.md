## Some WDI Concepts and Processes

[](10 mins)
### What is a computer
- takes intputs and produces output
- (used to take in 1s and 0s)
- now takes in in many kinds of input( music, video, text, touch, etc.)

- a computer is anything with these components
- can include many different kinds of objects today

### What is programming, what is software
- used to be written on punch cards

- now uses "real" language
- writing software is a process that expresses some problem domain in a set of logical instructions for how to process inputs and outputs
- documents that process for other programmers working on the system
- also gives instructions to the computer
- in a professional setting **equal importance is given to how you write software as to if it runs**
- (this is why WDI places so much emphasis on soft skills vs. hard skills)

### What is the internet
- interconnected network of computers
- a way to distribute your own software to anyone connected to the network

#### We will be writing *software* that runs on *computers* connected to the *internet*

### How to Write Software

#### Use Explicit Processes

- without a defined process it's impossible to know how to proceed
- software doesn't actually exist- you must give it structure and the process structure

#### Ask Lots of Questions

#### Attempt to Understand One Level Above and Below

#### Read Other People's Code

#### Pseudocode

### WDI Software Writiing Process

1. *Focus on the User*
1. Break your problems down into smaller problems
1. Build in small cycles (the smallest cycles possible)
1. incorporate those small cycles into larger cycles

### How to Solve Problems / How to ask questsions

- Don't say "It doesn't work- say I don't understand why it's not ___"

- Ananlyze your problems and come up with a hypothysis

- Express your explicit hypotheses

- Test your hypothisis

- If it's correct, you know what question to ask.

- If it's wrong you need a new hypothisis

- Ex: "why is it so hot in here?" am I on fire? No. Is it hot outside? No. Did someone turn the heater up too high? Etc....

- Move up or down the stack

- slow down
